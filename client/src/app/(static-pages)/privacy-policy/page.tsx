                            identifiable information from anyone under the age
                            of 13. If You are a parent or guardian and You are
                            aware that Your child has provided Us with Personal
                            Data, please contact Us. If We become aware that We

                            We take steps to remove that information from Our
                            servers.

                            requires consent from a parent, We may require Your
                            parent's consent before We collect and use that
                            information.
